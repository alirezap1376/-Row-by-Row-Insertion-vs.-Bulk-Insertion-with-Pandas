I recently tackled a project that required transferring data between SQL Server databases. To achieve this, I used Python to explore two distinct methods: direct row-by-row insertion and bulk insertion using the Pandas library. Hereâ€™s a closer look at each approach.

Method 1: Row-by-Row Insertion
In the first script, I used the pyodbc library to establish connections to both the source and target SQL Server databases. After extracting data from the 'salary' table, I created a new table 't2' in the target database. The data was then inserted row-by-row into 't2'. While this method provides fine-grained control over each row being inserted, it can be slower for large datasets due to the overhead of executing multiple insert statements.

Method 2: Bulk Insertion with Pandas
The second script highlights the efficiency of using Pandas for bulk data insertion. After querying the data into a Pandas DataFrame, I utilized the fast_to_sql library to handle the insertion into the target database. This method significantly speeds up the data transfer process, especially for large datasets, by leveraging the bulk insert capabilities of the database.
Both methods have their use cases: row-by-row insertion offers precise control, while bulk insertion with Pandas provides remarkable efficiency for handling large volumes of data. By combining Python's versatility with the robust data handling capabilities of Pandas, we can streamline database operations and improve overall performance
